                <h1>boredom</h1>
				<p>let's try to "characterize" i.e. spew out conversational instances where i'm bored lmao. for some definition of boredom.</p>
				<p>1 - when i'm tired/exhausted: the "interestingness level" of something needs to be pretty high when i'm tired for me to not think it's boring. because it has to feel better than relaxing, which actually feels pretty good (it's alone time, it's peace, it's presence, what else do i need lol)</p>
				<p>2 - when people are clearly not paying attention/listening: yes, we might be talking about something interesting. but if at least one person clearly loses interest, my attention then becomes shifted toward watching that person's reactions, which is probably even more interesting than the topic at hand hehe. but even then, i think there's some kind of bias kicking in where one person being bored leads to the overall mood swinging in that direction. just a theory, but it happens often enough that i don't think it's a coincidence</p>
				<p>3 - when i've already talked about something before: the first time i think about and talk about something is interesting. the second is interesting if i'm getting more content or coming up with new ideas and perspectves. the third is rarely interesting because i've probably thought about it enough and need a break, especially if these instances are separated by not a lot of time. but it turns out that the set of topics that i talk about with people aren't that diverse (i only think about a certain set of things, and they say people converge to the average of their friends, so something to this effect happens).</p>
				<p>4 - when i say something i think the other person knows and vice versa: i like adding value to someone's life when i'm with them. and if i'm not, it feels like i'm wasting both my time and the other person's time. so when i'm saying something you probably already know, i probably will get bored. but usually i only realize that you probably already know something when i'm halfway finished explaining, so i feel a desire to continue or something. if you say something that i know, i will also be bored. because the only knowledge i gain from this is that you know the specific fact you're telling me lol (and think it's cool enough to tell me or something). but just like redundancy, this falls under the theme of "wasting time"</p>
				<p>5 - things that have no direct application to my life: random facts can be interesting if interspersed sparsely, but if you're throwing a bunch of irrelevant things at me that i'm never going to think about or care about, i'm not going to be very interested. the news happens to do this, which is a part of why it bores me. but this can be hacked because mostly everything can have potential use in my life, you just have to figure out how ;)</p>
				<p>6 - when the conversation jumps around too much: if i'm having a conversation, i generally like focused conversations (think dfs on topics, not bfs) because jumpy things generally don't require much consideration and are correlated with shallow and more obvious type conversations. ofc this is just "stereotyping" and overgeneralizing but depth usually leads to characteristics like people thinking for longer, slower conversations, more interesting questions</p>
				<p>but of course this all only applies if i'm looking for a conversation. if i just want to enjoy someone's presence, this doesn't really matter because it's not about the conversation, it's about the person being there, so anything will feel good :')</p>
				<p>oh also here 6 instances where i will not be bored with you, without explanation, for symmetric purposes?</p>
				<p>1 - when i understand you better</p>
				<p>2 - when i just read something super thought provoking, want to discuss, and you entertain such a discussion</p>
				<p>3 - when you talk about your feelings and how i'm making you feel</p>
				<p>4 - when you make wildly absurd statements that you actually believe in</p>
				<p>5 - when you give me unsolicited advice about anything</p>
				<p>6 - when you tell me about how something affected you</p>

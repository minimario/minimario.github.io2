                <h1>personalities</h1>
				<p>We&rsquo;re always told to try new things. But one of the things that remains relatively constant in all of us is our personality. Sure, we change a bit here and there, and this usually happens when we face some high-impact event that brings us into a crisis of whether or not we want to be who we are right now. However, I&rsquo;m under the impression that most people don&rsquo;t change their personality too much on a daily basis.</p>
				<p>But why is this? It&rsquo;s so hard to change anything external. Any time I think about changing my personality a bit, I start thinking about how other people might perceive me differently. I feel a burst of shame at being someone else. I think about how I don&rsquo;t have enough self-compassion to be myself that I feel the urge to be somebody different. I become extremely self-conscious to the point where it no longer feels worthwhile to make the change. And well, people generally don&rsquo;t like to change things if things are going well. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m dissatisfied with myself, it&rsquo;s just that things could be even better if I did change. And the process of changing feels like things are getting worse (at least temporarily), which discourages me from continuing and hoping it will end up better. We like being ourselves, and loss aversion (we might lose our friends, people&rsquo;s understanding of us, etc.) keeps us from being someone different from who we are used to.</p>
				<p>Honestly, I can&rsquo;t imagine everyone being so satisfied with themselves that they wouldn&rsquo;t want to change if they were given the chance. Our personalities initially form as children due to the environment we grow up in, and when we start consciously thinking about how we might change ourselves, so many people are already used to our personality that it feels weird and awkward to change. But after all, so many people change from high school to college, so I&rsquo;d imagine there are people who would change again if they could. Unfortunately, I think we aren&rsquo;t actually given enough chances to put ourselves in fresh new environments where it&rsquo;s &ldquo;safe&rdquo; to do something like this. In my case, a lot of it is because I personally lack the courage to make these changes.</p>
				<p>Now, there are also plenty of one-off low-risk opportunities to temporarily change your personality. Some of these include any time you meet somebody new (they probably don&rsquo;t have strong impressions anyways, so you can make whatever first impression you want) and parties (where everyone&rsquo;s personality changes anyways, so you can be whoever you want). In these settings, you can be whoever you want and see how people will react to you, generally without serious consequences. Sometimes, I do enjoy experimenting a bit, altering things like voice, body language, openness, listening to talking ratio, etc. It&rsquo;s actually pretty nice to experience and be someone new, because sometimes, I&rsquo;m actually pretty tired of being myself! It&rsquo;s honestly extremely interesting emulating some of the things our friends (or not-friends) do, and seeing what kind of reactions we get in response. A nice space to do this is on BU&rsquo;s campus, where you&rsquo;re likely to know nobody there, nobody&rsquo;s going to see this totally different side of you, and as long as you can mentally prepare to be a new version of yourself, nothing too terrible&rsquo;s probably going to happen.</p>
				<p>But you can only be so many people at once, especially if you interact with these people again and again. Eventually, it becomes extremely tiresome to remember how you acted towards certain people and to be consistent each time. It&rsquo;s also mentally dissonant to think about all these different personalities and which one you really want to be. The answer&rsquo;s almost definitely a weighted combination of my current personality and some of my experimental personalities (with the former being weighted pretty high, actually). Also, if I&rsquo;m not consistent, I&rsquo;ll have to start explaining myself to people over and over, and people will become thoroughly confused. I also think that when people are not consistent, they begin to seem disingenuous, as if they&rsquo;re hiding something.</p>
				<p>However, the only way I can see of making drastic changes in your personality without seeming weird/disingenuous (those words feel off, but something like that) is to make permanent changes. But this totally destroys the experimental aspect of trying a bunch of different personalities and seeing which one suits you best. Because if you change 10 times over the course of 1 week, people will start thinking you&rsquo;ve become insane or something. But maybe part of this is all in my head. Maybe people aren&rsquo;t as sensitive to others&rsquo; changing as I&rsquo;m imagining them to be. While I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m comfortable absolutely ditching my current personality to experiment with drastic changes, I do feel like I am comfortable trying some smaller and less significant changes. Who knows, perhaps I&rsquo;ll be inspired by something...</p>

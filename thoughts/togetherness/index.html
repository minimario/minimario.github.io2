				<h1>togetherness</h1>
				<p>recently i've thought about what it really takes to satisfy my own social needs. sometimes when i spend time with someone it ends up feeling worse off than before. and sometimes, there are interactions that feel so good but i can't recreate them. first, i'll think about why things can feel so bad.</p>
				<p>often i feel something like "my interaction didn't live up to my expectations." these expectations are plenty: i expect to leave feeling better than before, i expect to feel connection at some point, i expect to catch up, i expect to rant at someone and be listened to, i expect to get to know someone i just met better. and then, if i decide to go back and think about that particular interaction, the first thing that comes to my mind is all the things that i didn't get that i expected. which gives me some feelings of "i suck at social things" like inadequacy or something (which, of course is a worry that's a remnant of my childhood phase where i did nothing but math problems and talked to absolutely nobody)</p>
				<p>mood is also pretty important. if i'm lonely because i had an argument with someone and feel like they don't accept me for who i am, i'm likely to have the same insecurities when i hang out with the next person. doubt, worry, and anxiety don't simply go away when i spend time with certain people. they're things that i need to take time to understand by myself, and by procrastinating on this by spending time with someone else, i feel as if i'm pushing aside my problems, which in itself feels like another problem</p>
				<p>there are also times (not too frequent though) where i read some inspiring self-help book that gives me some insightful technique regarding my next interaction and then i want to try and see what happens. while these types of things usually have long-term benefits, they feel horrible when i try them. it feels extremely inauthentic and the level of uncertainty is very high. there's also a lot of thought that goes into remembering techniques and observing the effects of them, which effectively increases self-consciousness. this ends up absorbing a lot of my energy and makes connection vibes almost nonexistent (translating them into self-experimental and self-growth vibes). which probably isn't bad, but i think i'm still not used to understanding that interactions having a secondary purpose of serving myself and making myself a better person even if connection doesn't result.</p>
				<p>an approximate generalization some previous points is that any pressure (which is usually self-induced) feels bad. i think this is why first interactions are usually hard because i feel self-induced pressure to "be worthwhile" (i think i wrote words on this before lol). if somebody's mad at you and there's pressure to make the situation better, there's an uneasiness that occurs even before you talk to them. if my last interaction with someone didn't go well but i want to try again, there's pressure to do better which ironically often makes things worse. even if there's pressure coming from a completely unrelated realm, like something going on with family, hanging out with people without talking about it feels bad. quite similar to the "avoiding problems" cause.</p>
				<p>conversation is also a pretty big part of how i feel when i leave an interaction a lot of the time, but that's a completely separate (and hard) thing to think about. so instead of that i'll reflect on some common themes in forms of togetherness that feel really good.</p>
				<p>there is a curiously large power that is presence. for example, walking around with someone you know in complete silence is strangely soothing. it feels as if both people acknowledge the silence, embrace that it's there, and accept each other's presence without verbal communication. a different instance of this is the library. when i work in the library, i often feel so much more productive than when i work alone. this is partially because everyone else is working, which provides some stimulus for me to work. but there's also a feeling of a bunch of people there with you, and it actually doesn't feel lonely at all even when i don't know anybody there. finally, there's staring into people's eyes for extended periods of time, the power of which is probably self-explanatory :')</p>
				<p>almost any interaction where i know that the other person really wants to be with me feels good. like if i ask someone to do something that they propose (and i enjoy), it usually feels better than when i propose something and i'm uncertain if it's something they really like doing. there's always a somewhat likely possibility that i'm dragging people into things that i like and that they don't want to say no to me.</p>
				<p>the more spontaneous something is, the better it feels. part of this is because if i want to do something spontaneously, i'm probably more excited about it than if it were planned. but another part of this is that spontaneity often removes expectations. even the activity was unplanned, which sets a mood of "lots of unplanned and random exciting things." when expectations (and norms hehe) are removed, we have the freedom to do whatever we want. so there's less pressure to do something "wrong"</p>
				<p>any form of understanding feels really good. when i'm really curious about someone and want to know more, and i end up learning a lot more about them, i feel super satisfied and fulfilled. there's both an internal success of "wow i did something right and said the right things" and an external success of "i had a goal of getting to know someone better and i did." positive impact feels extremely good (and negative impact therefore feels bad lol). knowing that the time you spent with someone made them feel better or happier or whatever is always a cure for the hidden insecurity of "am i wasting their time." when people tell me how i made them feel, it leads to better understanding, more connection, and overall closer vibes, all of which are really nice things! steps toward resolved conflicts (and more generally any tension dissolution) is also good. if you think someone hates you and they shed light on that fact (even if they do reveal that it's true), it removes uncertainty and gives you better understanding of the situation. while this honesty doesn't feel good at the moment, the hidden subtext of them trusting you enough to tell you these things politely and genuinely ends up making things feel better.</p>

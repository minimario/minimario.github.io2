                <h1>rewards and processes</h1>
				<p>going back to school gives me a feeling of constraint. it feels like there's something i "should be doing" one thing that happened is a lack of motivation. when you've been on break for 2 weeks, perfectly relaxed and never feeling like an unproductive time was unjustified, you wonder, "why can't i just live my entire life relaxed..." it really makes me wonder what things i&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;want to do and what things seem appealing just for a split second. and it's actually quite hard for me to differentiate these things, because, well, they feel the same in the present moment. consider keeping this blog updated, for instance. sometimes i wonder if i want to keep it updated from my heart or if i want to keep it updated because i feel an obligation to.</p>
				<p>we want a lot of things in life, but do we really know why we want them? while surprising, i think a lot of what we want actually comes from a combination of admiration and jealousy. we see someone else doing something. we like the result. we admire or are jealous of the person for achieving some result. we want to recreate the result, and therefore we become really disillusioned with creating the result that we follow what we think are the steps they take to get the result. or maybe we actually know the steps they took to get to the result. and then we give ourselves a timeline for achieving the result and fall into planning fallacy or something. and once we get off schedule we become demotivated again because we're not going to achieve what we thought we would.</p>
				<p>so, well, let's say there's a result we want to achieve. now, let's consider a process of achieving such a result. we often ask ourselves, "is this result worth the process?" i think often we think way too much about "result" and not "process." and this causes us to pursue a lot of processes we don't enjoy that have a result that we do enjoy. so when we invest in something, we should think about not just "is the outcome worth the process" but also "how enjoyable is this process and how much does it contribute to the greater outcome which is my life?" because there are surely a lot of things for which we enjoy both the process and the outcomes. why aren't we pursuing them then?</p>
				<p>i've also found a partial hack to jacking up the enjoyment level of the process--which is to detail pessimistic-realistic steps to achieving your goal which then you actually achieve, which will artifially hack your brain to enjoy the process more (since you're achieving something, right)? that if you set enough goals artificially you'll delude yourself into thinking achieving these goals means you've done something and then become happy! this is probably the basis between apps like habitica, which give you rewards for achiving your own goals (yay for somehow finding motivation to get up and run at 7am while i have a headache and was sick???) and the addictive concept of "streaks" (ok you've done it 5 days in a row, don't wanna break it now do you)</p>
				<p>but then sometimes i just feel like i wanna laze around and do nothing. and while these goals and streaks prevent me from doing this, it also has some kind of effect on me where i start to feel tired and never feel like i get to rest. because the day i went back from mit, i felt a restfulness that i hadn't felt in a semester. which means that i probably didn't give myself an opportunity to really chill and completely shut myself down at any point. and once i give myself a chance to rest, i will then find some internal motivation to do things disjoint from the things i wanted to do before (could these be the things i&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;want to do vs. are socially conditioned to want to do? oop scary thought)</p>
				<p>i do realize that i have much less of a handle on what i really want than i originally thought. and maybe it's interesting to find ways to be more honest with yourself with what you want. because there are a lot of layers that have already diluted the core personality that is me (other people's wants, the environment around me, what i read, social conditioning, etc.) and have made it difficult to separate myself from life, basically. but i don't know. it feels like the desires of "relaxed me" are my true desires. but maybe that's wrong too.</p>
				<p>anyways since i'm tired of thinking about this i'll start being superficial and list some things that this applies to? i'll give vague evaluations of process/reward amounts to some of my recent free-time activities. keeping this blog (ok process, nice reward), making friends (ok process, nice reward), learning a new piano piece (semi-ok process, very nice reward), exploring cities (nice process, ok reward), learning a prog language (ok process, ok reward), research (ok with high std process, nice reward), watching anime (nice process, low reward), getting drunk (ok-nice process, negative reward), running authentic relating (ok process, ok reward), reading/implementing self-help (ok-nice process w/ high std, ok-nice reward), reading books (usu nice process, nice reward), crying (nice process, ok reward), writing (semi-ok process, nice reward), learning to unicycle (painful process, nice reward), journaling (nice process, ok reward)</p>

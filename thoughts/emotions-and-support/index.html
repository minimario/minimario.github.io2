                <h1>emotions and support</h1>
				<p>- recently i&apos;ve been talking to a lot of people about various things related to emotions and support. here is a collection of various thoughts!</p>
				<p>- a lot of people don&apos;t like asking their friends for emotional support. however, when you ask someone for emotional support, you inevitably become closer as friends. this also makes the other person feel much more comfortable asking you for emotional support. making the first move is hard, but pays off in the long run</p>
				<p>- sometimes people are cynical when you try to help them because they wonder if the words you&apos;re saying are true rather than serving the purpose of comforting them. when this happens, it&apos;s possible that silence and pure presence is the way to go.</p>
				<p>- another common perspective when someone is helping you is that you&apos;re being a burden and wasting their time. on the other hand, it often feels good to help other people, so a lot of people like being approached for help and helping others (we are generally pretty altruistic toward our friends?)</p>
				<p>- telling anyone about your emotional issues allows you to put your issues &quot;out there,&quot; making the issues feel more &quot;real&quot; and sharing your issues with someone else. this is likely one of the reasons that ranting sometimes feels good to people, because it&apos;s a form of sharing your issues with someone else, lifting some of that burden, and inducing some form of connection</p>
				<p>- people feel a lot better when they realize that they&apos;re not the only ones going through a specific situation. when you&apos;re experiencing strong emotions, it&apos;s common to think that you&apos;re the only person who knows how you feel. but with the billions of people in the world, there must be someone that&apos;s been through similar situations. reminding people of common humanity is really powerful.</p>
				<p>- a lot of helping someone is just listening and being there for them. it might give them a sense of security and let them know that they have someone to rely on if they ever need. and that there are people who are willing to listen to their story.</p>
				<p>- crying is an amazing form of self-support. it&apos;s a way of amplifying my feelings, bringing back some of the old memories I have, processing my emotions by tuning out a lot of what&apos;s around me, and giving myself the necessary head space to express my own feelings</p>
				<p>- distracting yourself from your emotions sometimes works, but often the emotions resurface after the distraction has ended, in a more aggressive manner. it&apos;s a form of self-empathy to let your emotions be there instead of hide yourself from them. refusing to accept your own emotions undermines trust between you and your emotions.</p>
				<p>- meditation is one way of stopping your mind from thinking about things all the time. it also seems to have led me to be more accepting of my own feelings, at least when they&apos;re not extremely strong.</p>
				<p>- exercising seems to make me be able to process my emotions better. perhaps during the process of exercising, my mind takes a break and focuses on exercising rather than my emotions, and then, once I feel much more relaxed, i am in a better position to deal with them</p>
				<p>- the tone of voice you use when helping someone can really make a difference. there&apos;s really a large range of &quot;comforting tones,&quot; and different people seem to find comfort in different tones</p>
				<p>- having two people help one person is a sketchy idea but may be useful sometimes in case you&apos;re not too confident about your ability to help someone alone. it eases the pressure off of the &quot;therapists.&quot; however, it&apos;s much harder to share yourself with two people than one, because with three people, there are three distinct dynamics of how pairs of people interact around each other, which might be difficult to reconcile</p>
				<p>- it&apos;s really, really hard to tell when someone&apos;s not feeling emotionally well. a lot of people won&apos;t tell you unless you ask them directly and show that you really care. &quot;how are you&quot; rarely elicits such a response. but if you add some expression of concern (e.g., &quot;you look sad, is everything alright?&quot;), people are much more willing to tell you, because you&apos;re essentially communicating that you&apos;re ready to listen if they want to tell you something sad.</p>

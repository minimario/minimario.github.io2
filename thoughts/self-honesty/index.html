                <h1>self honesty</h1>
				<p>being honest with myself is really, really hard. and demotivating. but until now, i haven't really gotten a chance to actually do this. false confidence is nice. idealizing things is nice. it prevents you from feeling all the scary emotions that result from, well, scary things.</p>
				<p>but these things also conjure up internal feelings of uncertainty. consider a statement like "people around me don't hate me" (yes, you may never know the truthness of this statement). deep down inside, i somewhere have the fear that this statement is actually true. that every time someone interacts with me, they pretend to be nice because of politeness and all that, but inside they hate me. because, well, i haven't proved it to be impossible. but i tell myself, "haha the probability of this is so small," so i never end up actually thinking about this. and every time a thought like this comes up i probably dismiss it and suppress it or something like that. but internally, the worry doesn't go away. it shows up when i dream, when i cry, and during emotional avalanches.</p>
				<p>i've recently found that actually considering statements like this at face value ends up alleviating a lot of this internal worry. actually saying to myself, so let's say people really hate me. it does take a while to get myself to internalize that this is true (and i admit this isn't easy either). now of course, i can't simulate the feeling of this statement being 100% true, but it does make me really uncomfortable. and while it's temporarily uncomfortable, by running some self-empathy things on yourself and really investigating where the source of these feelings come from, i find that i can make myself feel quite a bit better at the end of everything.</p>
				<p>it's like pursuing a project, and after dedicating hundreds of hours to this project and asking yourself, "what if this project is completely useless?" when you're trying to get yourself to work on the project, this feeling is something that you want to completely destroy (it just sucks up motivation, jacks up the worry meter, and sucks for productivity if it's defined by how much of the project is done). but then if the project really _is_ completely useless for anything and you're not even motivated but somehow got yourself to work through it all, you burned through a bunch of time and resources and yourself without much gain. so well, while this is just a toy example, it's like asking yourself, in the middle, the hard and honest question of "is this really worth it?" let's say you think about it and conclude "yes." then you'll feel way better and actually get real motivation stemming from yourself concluding that this is worth it. and let's say you conclude no. it's possible that you've overlooked something, but at the end of it all, you've saved yourself a bunch of time and energy (and well, it's just another risk to take, right?) while the "no" would be pretty disappointing to yourself, otherwise you'd just be... deluding yourself?</p>
				<p>so yeah, there is a beauty of getting off the autopilot of life, looking at all the pieces of your life, thinking about what really worries you deep down that you've pushed away, and embracing that a lot of change might happen. it really could be heard to hear the truthness ("truthness") of questions like "do i really like my current plan to get through college" or "has this class been an entire waste of time" or "am i being honest to myself" or "is reading self-help books just a complete waste" or "will my parents be okay" or "do i like being in a relationship" or other deeper and scarier things. but at the end, it's worth it.</p>

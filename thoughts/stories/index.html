                <h1>stories</h1>
				<p>Sharing and listening to each others&rsquo; stories is one of the most wholesome and intimate ways that we connect with one another. By stories, I don&rsquo;t mean stories about we failed a test or got drunk with a bunch of friends at a frat party, but rather stories that really shed insight on who we are as a person. Stories like the time when we cried as we thought about all our broken friendships, stories like the time we couldn&rsquo;t fit in to a group we really wanted to be a part of, stories like the time we idealized our futures and reality disappointed us. Through stories, we transmit bursts of their own emotions and slices of their vivid memories onto me. In short, stories is how we share our world with each other.</p>
				<p>Rarely are we able to feel accepted and understood while we share our own moments and feelings with complete authenticity. In my average conversation, I rarely feel like I&rsquo;m being truly listened to. People often interrupt to inject their own ideas, talk over us when they&rsquo;re bored of listening to what we have to say, check their phones once in a while to see if they got any new texts, and so on. How is it even possible to feel connection, when we&rsquo;re barely looking at each other, sporadically listening to us while thinking about themselves or something, and constantly interrupting each other to get our own thoughts in?</p>
				<p>When people share stories, others listen much more intently and are much more interested. They listen with patience. They listen with empathy. They listen with sincerity and openness. From the reactions on their faces and the posture of their bodies, you know that they&rsquo;re really listening and have a genuine interest in you as a person. There&rsquo;s an amazing feeling of being actually accepted and valued as a person. There&rsquo;s the warmth of knowing that there&rsquo;s somebody that&rsquo;s interested in you and willing to listen to you while empathizing with everything you&rsquo;ve been through. That people appreciate you for who you are, overlooking all the flaws that you feared people wouldn&rsquo;t accept about you. It gives me a boost of self-compassion as I remember that there really are people that will accept you for you.</p>
				<p>It&rsquo;s even better when you&rsquo;re on the receiving end. Hearing about other people&rsquo;s lives is just as precious and heartwarming as well. Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve begun to internalize that people are really people. That everyone has anxieties, that everyone has struggles, that everyone has secrets that they wished somebody would be receptive to but won&rsquo;t share in fear of rejection. But when they know they&rsquo;ll be listened to, when they trust us to receive their messages in raw and unfiltered form, and when parts of their unique self begin to permeate, they begin to feel comfortable being themselves. When we give people a chance to simply express themselves however they want to, we unlock insights on how they&rsquo;re feeling, what they&rsquo;re thinking about, and more generally, everything that makes them who they are as a person. Whenever people tell me stories, especially people who I&rsquo;m friends with, I always feel infinitely more connected, warm, and appreciative for them.</p>
				<p>Being in a setting where we can simply sit together and share our lives is rare. It's really not a social norm that we listen to each other quietly without interrupting, unless we're complaining or angry at each other. However, we should really try and find more opportunities to share more slices of our own life with our friends. Our own humanity really is touching, and people really do like knowing that we are also human. Whether we&rsquo;re sharing with our closest friends or strangers that we just met, stories simply provide another opportunity to experience a unique wholesomeness and feel genuine appreciation and acceptance.</p>

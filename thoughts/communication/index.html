                <h1>communication</h1>
				<p>lol bullet points because copy pasted</p>
				<p>- the well-known model of communication breaks it down into four parts: you have a thought, you somehow encode it into words, the other person listens to your words, and the other person takes those words and transmits them into their own thoughts. i'd imagine that each of these steps is far from perfectly efficient (the space of thoughts intuitively seems much larger than the space of possible phrases, and there's also the thing that different languages can express different ideas, that language affects the way we think, etc). so given this idea, the prospect of communicating to each other in a coherent way seems like a miracle.</p>
				<p>- so i was doing this thing where i tried to reconcile present me with past me. and i realized that it was really hard for present me to empathize with past me or get into the mindset of past me. so thinking about how much i've changed over the last few weeks/months/years, it's still a weird concept that other people don't think like me. sometimes i like to look at past me and be condescending and tell past me that he wasn't mature enough to understand some concepts that i understand now. i was trying to have a dialogue with past me regarding why he didn't value anything except doing ~math~ (lol) and i will say that it was extremely frustrating but kinda cute. but at the end, i felt pretty disconnected from myself and am still very confused. it's like i'm meeting a person who i haven't seen in a while that's totally different from me, scary...</p>
				<p>- but given this idea that i can barely communicate with ourself how am i supposed to even remotely communicate with other people? the only evidence surrounding the fact that our brains are even remotely similar is "science", but if they weren't the field wouldn't even exist, so maybe psychology is just picking at the similarities between us and ignoring the differences or something. like if everyone really does experience different colors or something we couldn't ever be sure? are we really communicating with words, or do words just limit the set of things the other person is saying to a large space which we then guess at via facials/other signals? they do say a lot of communication is nonverbal, so :')</p>
				<p>- there is also a weird thing where a central theme of conflict resolution literature revolves around the concept of trying to discover each others' values. as if values are a basis for how we think? but i think that we all fundamentally perceive values extremely differently. the fact that we have ask each other "what is love to you" so frequently is just one example that we all think so differently. but somehow we still use the same term to describe these vastly different things so it's strange how we can somehow feel like we get a grasp of the other person</p>
				<p>- ok now let's talk about empathy. is empathy just when someone talks about something and then we project how bad it is based on how much it would hurt to us? or that we have heard people with a similar experience and they seemed to be in pain (reminder that we have no idea what the notion of what others' pain is like). so aside from the prospect that we're just projecting everything to ourselves, what are other possibilities? it's an interesting phenomenon that we see someone in pain, and then we feel some flavour of sadness. where does this come from? there are, of course, selfish motives: we are losing a friend, we see something that might happen to our lives and then become a little sad, and other things you might be able to come up with.. but aside from that, how are we programmed to feel bad for other people? is it actually something that is internal, or is it just a "social norm" that we sucked up subconsciously and became a part of ourselves? (more sad "we have no individualism" vibes).</p>
				<p>- but this gives rise to an optimistic possibility that our genes are all connected and therefore, we really do share common experiences and common feelings :o but that being said, it seems really hard to be able to compare our conceptions of feelings, because all we have to describe them are a finite set of words whose length is far less than the number of people on the planet, so we'll all describe them the same way.</p>

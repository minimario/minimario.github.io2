				<h1>why is blogging a good thing</h1>
				<p>For like two years, I've had a sporadic urge to start a blog. Yet, I've procrastinated again and again. In fact, I almost&nbsp;applied to become an MIT Admissions blogger. The idea genuinely sounded exciting: lucrative pay, free-form writing, sharing your own feelings, helping future students navigate the institution, what's there not to like?&nbsp;But then&nbsp;I thought about how much better I'd feel if I just wrote whenever I wanted and for myself&nbsp;and feel absolutely&nbsp;no obligation and that idea died. Each time I was about to start a blog, I came up with another excuse. People won't like what I write. I'm too busy. I'll lose the energy after a while, and people who do actually read my blog would be disappointed. Blogging is worthless because I have no reason to write for other people when I can write for myself. Well, all these statements are true. But as I flew home for Thanksgiving, I became excited and inspired while reading through a bunch of random blog posts that I had saved on my laptop. So well, instead of finding a bunch of reasons&nbsp;not&nbsp;to start a blog, I convinced myself (perhaps this is just brainwashing after all) of all the great reasons that I should. Here goes...</p>
				<p>There is a mysterious feeling&nbsp;that&nbsp;arises&nbsp;when I share random personal information about&nbsp;myself&nbsp;to random people. It's some combination of impact, half-connection, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;ego boost that probably results from thinking you're being "inspirational" or something. Plus "omg&nbsp;they are judging me" and "thank god I won't have to see them again" and "I hope I'm worth your time" and a bunch of other anxieties that go through my head. Even while writing this, I'm thinking about how people might react after reading this. But I do need to build more self-confidence and self-compassion anyways, so might as well :&rsquo;)</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve told myself it doesn't matter! I've convinced myself, maybe?, that the real purpose of writing this is for me to find a way to throw raw thoughts out in a way that is slightly more coherent than the way they're in my head. And maybe people reading this will get something from it. The beauty of writing&nbsp;is that while most people&nbsp;won't just leave if you're talking and they&nbsp;don't care and are waiting for the moment you're done, people will happily hit the Ctrl-W if they don't like what they're reading. So I feel like I'm allowed to just throw out some crap that's in my mind, and if you don't like what you're reading, I won't be wasting your time.</p>
				<p>All of this can be achieved if I just journal to myself, right? The thing is that writing as if people are going to read it and as if someone is actually receiving your message feels vastly different than journaling. It&rsquo;s also another opportunity to experience what it feels like to be vulnerable in the form of sharing thoughts without necessarily knowing&nbsp;how people will react. My inner voice also becomes slightly stronger, and I think slightly harder when I&rsquo;m writing as if somebody&rsquo;s reading. People will also respond and I will have more things to think about. I'll also have a higher chance of going back and reading things I wrote for sentimental value. And of course, there's some joy that comes from sharing your world with actual people :)</p>
				<p>There are also practical benefits, probably. People might relate and feel better. Or&nbsp;people&nbsp;might&nbsp;find me to be a more interesting person (or less, but oh well).&nbsp;Or&nbsp;people&nbsp;might&nbsp;understand me better. Or people might sympathize or empathize or connect with me. Maybe I'll have more motivation to reflect.</p>
				<p>I have no idea if this is actually a good idea. But well, no better way to find out than to start!</p>

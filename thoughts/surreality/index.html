				<h1>surreality</h1>
				<p>omg, never in my life have I felt so free. people always tell me they feel so much different every time they go home. i wholeheartedly agree: it feels so good to be home. yes, I&rsquo;m sad that I&rsquo;ve left my friends for winter break. but I&rsquo;m happy that there finally exists time and space for myself. i can feel life slowing down and envision the expansion of space time. there&rsquo;s no longer constant self-pressure to be productive, but instead a nice sense of being able to take a few days and do whatever I want with them without feeling guilty at all. because, well, there&rsquo;s literally no sense of obligation whatsoever.</p>
				<p>life in college is fast, scary fast. there are times where it drags, but at almost every point in the semester, there&rsquo;s always a sense of needing to be productive and keeping track of time and whatever. whether it&rsquo;s a social event or a club meeting or a deadline, there&rsquo;s always a sense of urgency somewhere. but life at home is slow, in a beautifully sense. there&rsquo;s almost no pressure to do anything (though I&rsquo;d be lying if I omitted the almost), and I&rsquo;m actually able to feel the nonchalance of something that seems like a more natural pace of life.</p>
				<p>there&rsquo;s also the comfort of books. since I left MIT, I&rsquo;ve already gone through two books and far through a third. i&rsquo;ve forgotten the niceness of being able to relate to someone and actually have evidence (!?) that you&rsquo;re not alone in this world, even if it&rsquo;s just a fictional character from a novel. the combination of beautiful language and relatable plot is basically paradise.</p>
				<p>i also spent a solid consecutive hour on fb for the first time since, probably, the start of the year. while limiting my fb time during the school year is probably one of the better self-control moves I&rsquo;ve made this semester, there&rsquo;s a nice nostalgia that comes from scrolling through my fb feed and passively absorbing the intimate life details of both my closest friends and, well, people I barely even remember.</p>
				<p>there&rsquo;s a feeling of belonging that comes from being back at a place that you&rsquo;ve lived in for seventeen years. even just meandering around my backyard brings back so many memories that it&rsquo;s just hard not to feel nostalgic. there are also other differences that cultivate the sense of belonging, like being able to take showers without shoes (!) and living in an actual bed (!!) and being able to see everyone again from family to old friends, something like being reintegrated back into a community (or family) that I had temporarily left (!!!)</p>
				<p>of course, I also must not forget the serenity of being alone. being alone is just&hellip; ahh so nice; it&rsquo;s like you have complete control of your life and wow control is something I have literally not had in so long. it&rsquo;s like I finally have permission to do anything and everything that I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do. i also just needed to sort out the mess that was last semester. it's like any sense of social obligation or social pressure is k i l l e d. so yes I literally sat down, wrote words for five consecutive hours, and boy it just felt so good releasing all the knots in my mind (haha i&rsquo;m not going to put these words on here though; most of it probably wouldn't make sense anyways)</p>
				<p>finally, there&rsquo;s a unparalleled sense of security that comes from being back at home. as hard as I try to delude myself into thinking that MIT feels like home sometimes, the feeling of being back at my&nbsp;<em>real home</em>&nbsp;can&rsquo;t even match that of being back at my dorm after a long day of studying or partying or whatever. there&rsquo;s a guarantee that nobody&rsquo;s going to randomly barge into your door when you&rsquo;re crying or meditating, a guarantee that you can write some words to yourself and nobody will ever see interrupt you, a guarantee that everyone around you will just accept you and love you no matter what. the feeling of being able to just be myself securely is just so&hellip; foreign. really, it&rsquo;s this that distinguishes family from my closest friends. a sense of full trust, confidence, and security in every step you take.</p>
				<p>life just feels so great, and words simply cannot express how great it feels~</p>
				<p>wow.</p>

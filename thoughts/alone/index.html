                <h1>alone</h1>
                <p>i&rsquo;m not enough, i tell myself. i&rsquo;m not enough. i need to work harder, i need to take more breaks, i need to find a vision for myself, i need to plan out my life. seek my dreams, they tell me. find my passion. discover what true love means. uncover your emotions. ask myself who i want to be. and become that person. that&apos;s what they all say.</p>
                <p>but why do i listen? why am i so foolish that all the words you tell me are gospel to my ears? why am i in a world, plagued by so many human beings, drowning in so many artificial metrics of success and happiness? the instant you compliment me, congratulate me, reward me, does it mean i&apos;ve done something right? or have i simply stepped one iota closer to what the world aspires me to be?</p>
                <p>the problem isn&apos;t society. it&apos;s me. it&apos;s not the standards looming around my life. it&apos;s my choice to succumb myself to those vortices, those spirals towards artificial fame or mere moments of feeling accomplished. it&apos;s my inability to take a step back, view the world as the world, and not as an extension of me. i know i&apos;m slipping, but what can i do about it? i can&apos;t separate myself from the world and quite literally, i&apos;m attached. i can&apos;t tell me from we. like, where do you end, and where do i begin? who says i need to find my place in this world?</p>
                <p>i wanna be myself, i say. i want to be unique. to be special. to be loved. to be appreciated. to feel like i have a special corner in this world, reserved just for me. why can&apos;t i just be alone, in isolation, in a place of no obligation. on a foreign island, never to be seen by anyone else. what if i were just disentangled from the rest of the world? i can&apos;t. i&apos;ll find myself a million reasons for that. because nobody else does it. because i need the world to feel my feelings. because of all those external stimuli. because i love my parents and i can&apos;t leave them.</p>
                <p>no, i can&apos;t leave. people like me. if i gracefully exit their world i&apos;ll cause a scene. they&apos;ll be sad. am i dreaming? or am i just imagining. i don&apos;t know, but i&apos;m probably just disguising my own cowardice as selflessness. because i&apos;m not selfless. then why can&apos;t i be so selfish to just disappear for a few hours, maybe a few days, or years? would people notice my absence? would they accept it? would life move on?</p>
                <p>look, why do i care? is it so deeply entrenched in me to care about people? once again, i&apos;ve forgotten how to be alone again. what is it even like to be in a state of pure quietude, to embrace the comfort of myself? what&apos;s so tempting about being with others? are all my emotions and thoughts not complex enough to pique my curiosity?</p>
                <p>feeling connection is good, making friends is good, meeting people is good, gaining new perspectives is good, they tell me. but nobody ever tells me that being lonely is good? it&apos;s not a worthwhile goal to pursue, they say. i swear if i ever told my friends my life goal was to be more lonely, they&apos;d say, alex, that&apos;s dumb of you. it&apos;s too easy, i tell myself. it&apos;s meaningless. it&apos;s a waste of time. why would i ever want to be by myself? when i could just enjoy your company, when i accomplish so much, when i could change someone&apos;s life, as they say</p>
                <p>but that&apos;s the issue. i begin to value you, your opinions, your thoughts, your ways of living. i begin to value all the things they tell me are good. i tell myself i want to go change the world and make everything better and how that&apos;s a correct way to live. i tell myself that&apos;s so much better than being alone and once again, it&apos;s a great excuse from entering loneliness once again.</p>
                <p>some day, it&apos;ll happen. you&apos;ll miss me. and i&apos;ll miss you. but i&apos;ll discover who i really am, what i really want. i&apos;ll remember all the moments where i was fascinated purely by myself. not even the hazy backdrop of the sky right in front of my eyes, but just myself. and once i find myself, i&apos;ll be able to find you again. i&apos;ll find you in a different light, playing a different role, but no less important than you were before. if i can social distance my body, i can social distance my mind. yes, just my thoughts. just myself. alex. myself. yes.</p>
                <p>man, literally imagining it is giving me bliss. i just yearn to be alone. but do i really? nah, i&apos;m probably just appealing to my fantasies once more</p>

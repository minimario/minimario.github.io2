				<p>I've been extremely stressed over the last few weeks, ever since Thanksgiving. Recently, I stumbled upon one likely reason for this.</p>
				<p>Pressure is a magical thing, positively correlated to stress, productivity, dizziness, sleeplessness, and excitement at the same time. It's also one of the things I've felt all over the place this year. Some of these pressures include pressure to constantly be working on a group project even when you're exhausted, pressure to cry, pressure to stop crying because it's a waste of time, pressure to spend time with my friends, pressure to hang out with someone you don't want to, pressure to call family even when you're not in the mood to do it, pressure to show my friends that I have value in their life.</p>
				<p>Over the past few weeks, over 50% of the messages I've get induce some new form of pressure into me, so I've felt extremely constrained. From "have you literally done nothing in the past day" to "I would also like to point out that interaction time this week is equal to 3.5 hours," it feels like I'm being manipulated by everyone around me to give them my time. And really, it does feel bad. I feel worthless when I'm not able to give my friends the time that they want from me. I feel incompetent that that I'm not able to spend as much time on a group project as my partners want. But I also feel helpless amidst all of this mess. Inside me, there's a need to spend time with myself. And that's something I heavily procrastinate on. Over the course of the semester, with such a high "things that need to be done" per unit time density, the value I've been placing on self-care has gone down. There are things I really enjoy doing-taking walks, going on adventures, exploring cities, meditation, journaling-that I haven't been able to keep up with. My thoughts have gradually shifted from thinking about my internal state to thinking about who I need to satisfy.</p>
				<p>I'm losing time for myself, and this is slowly killing me inside. When I go to bed, it takes me much longer to fall asleep. A constant stream of thoughts floods me as soon as I lay down, and I haven't gotten the chance to simply sit down and properly reflect on my life in the last two weeks. As someone who really values autonomy, seeing myself doing things for other people hurts. But it's that as much as I value autonomy, I also value approval. And this sucks.</p>
				<p>It's really, really hard to have both. I believe that while I value approval, I wish I didn't as much. Don't get me wrong-I like compliments, I like when people appreciate me, and I like doing nice things for other people if it makes them feel good. This, of course, makes me feel validated as a human person. But sometimes, when there's a lot of chaos and messiness going on in my own life that I need to sort out, I wished that I could at least partially ignore other people pushing me around and prioritize myself just as much as I prioritize other people. I keep on telling myself, "ah, self-care can wait." But it's waited, and it's waited forever. I either drop commitments to myself, or I drop commitments to other people.</p>
				<p>Where am I really going with this? Who knows. I used to write a schedule of what I would do each day at the start of each day. This would probably give me a sense of responsibility and feel more comfortable rejecting when somebody wanted me to do something in the moment. Though this also gets rid of&nbsp;spontaneity, something I really do value as well. Maybe I'll do this a bit more. Maybe I'll also just... learn to take care of myself and learn to say no without feeling bad myself.&nbsp;One interesting framing that convinces me is "if they knew everything I was going through, then they would totally understand why I'm saying no." And this, I believe, gives me internal permission to reject the things that I want to say no to without feeling bad.&nbsp;Now that I've brought the problem to the forefront of my mind, I'd like to&nbsp;start proactively&nbsp;finding more ways to make myself less stressed while keeping a compromise between self-care and care for my friends.</p>

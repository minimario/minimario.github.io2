                <p>meant to post this publicly sometime earlier, but debated whether or not it was a good idea for a while..</p>

                <p>Last Tuesday, notice was sent out for all MIT students to leave campus within a week. When I first heard about the rumor that this was happening, unlike everyone else, who all seemed worried and devastated, I was thrilled. Yes, I was sad that I would no longer have friends around me. I was sad that online learning would be nothing close to the familiar environment of a classroom. However, I was excited. I couldn't explain why, but it felt freeing, as if the semester had ended and I could finally reclaim my own life again.</p>
                
                <p>But obviously, the semester hadn't ended. There would still be online classes, there would still be problem sets, there would still be exams. There was obviously a lot of idealizing going on. I remembered the relief that I felt last December when I finally came home to good news that alleviated almost all of the worries that I had carried the entire semester. Without thinking twice, I imagined that this was what it would feel like.</p>
                
                <p>Even now, it's difficult for me to tell how much of this news I had idealized. I had been looking forward to spring break, when I could go home, write my heart out, read and immerse myself into fictitious worlds, run and scream down the streets, and really, just live, slow down, and enjoy each moment that would pass worry-free and in peace. It felt like this just came early for me.</p>
                
                <p>While I wasn't surprised, I felt shame and guilt over my own feelings when I realized how panicked everyone else was. The only glimpse anyone ever saw as to how unlocked and alive I felt inside was when I channeled my inner excitement at my roommate while packing (I'm quite sure he thought I was going insane). While I was at one of my happiest points in the semester, I'm quite sure that nobody shared my sentiment.</p>
                
                <p>However, with each person I talked to, I became increasingly normalized to the mood of MIT campus. When person after person told me how stressed they were buying plane tickets, how sad they were to say goodbye to their friends for the last time, and how scared they were of not being able to find a place to stay, my mood gradually swung between my own happiness and others' sadness.</p>
                
                <p>I usually know how I feel. But in this instance, I didn't. I tried to compare my feelings with a variety of situations in the past: the bittersweetness of leaving campus last summer, the emptiness I felt when I sent my girlfriend off to the airport during CPW, the loneliness I felt when I was the only Chinese person in a heated discussion about identity. Nothing even felt remotely similar.</p>
                
                <p>This was one of the instances where I've questioned my own emotions the most. While I'm often one of the only people to hold a particular belief, I don't recall feeling emotions so different from eveyone else. I found myself extremely insecure about my own feelings, and I begin to doubt my own happiness when someone said that my excitement was just an expression of anxiety. Somebody who knew how I felt asked me, "you're happy about this, aren't you?" But I wasn't comfortable expressing how happy I was at the exact same event that made everyone else feel depressed, anxious, and infuriated. My friends were feeling all these emotions and I wanted to make sure everyone was safe and felt better. I thought that expressing my real emotions would compromise the well-being of my friends. Whenever I was trying to help a friend feel better, I felt like I was sacrificing my own expression for their emotional sake.</p>
                
                <p>By suppressing my true emotions over and over, my happiness was gradually taken over by sadness, both over the situation and over the shame that I felt over my own feelings. I repeatedly tried to convince myself that it was okay to feel good and that everyone's circumstances were different, but the emotional peer pressure was too much for me to retain my own emotions.</p>
                
                <p>Tinges of anxiety and heavy-heartedness gradually began to infiltrate my thoughts, and any optimism I originally had for the situation slowly lost themselves among the negativity that dominated my mind. Whenever I saw someone that seemed happy to leave, my immediate reaction was that of cynicism: they're sad, but don't want to show their sadness and are putting on a mask of positivity.</p>
                
                <p>Life inside me returned back to "normal" (ironically) Wednesday morning as I was able to clarify my own feelings: a large mix of feelings dominated by freedom and sadness. Freedom because I could finally get the opportunity to spend more time for myself with reading, writing, walking around, exploring the world, etc., but also sadness from leaving all my dearest friends so soon with the thought that I would no longer being able to create a myriad of memories until next fall.</p>
                
                <p>My feelings are still blurry. And while I wasn't able to fully capitalize on the positivity that first struck me when I heard the news of the future, the general sentiment inside me is once again optimism at the opportunity to create for myself a new lifestyle.</p>

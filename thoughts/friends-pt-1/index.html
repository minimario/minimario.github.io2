                <h1>friends, part 1</h1>
				<p>Note 1: This post is unfinished, nor do I plan on finishing it. But I've posted it anyways, because why not :')</p>
				<p>Note 2: There's some similar content <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t86fq936fbcqde5/gu.essay.3.pdf?dl=0">here</a>; this is an essay I wrote for a class (21W.747), so it's probably not as free-form as&nbsp;something I'd normally write. It's also in speech form, which is awkward, but fit the constraints of the assignment nicely... oh well :)</p>
				<p>I constantly think about what I want my friendship situation to be like. How many friends do I want? How close do I want them to be? What do I want them to be like? How deliberate should I be in choosing my friends? How proactive should I be? My view on friendships never ceases to change. In middle school, the value I placed on friendships was practically 0. It gradually increased in my high school years, and peaked during my freshmen year, where I did everything I could to try to optimize my friend group for things like diversity, number, and closeness. Since then, it's gone down a bit. So looking at the bigger picture, why is it that I want friends at all?</p>
				<p>There's social pressure. Nobody wants to be that one person in a class that can't find a partner when the teacher tells everyone to get into groups, and nobody wants everyone else to see them alone at a party with nobody to talk to. Since childhood, we're often exposed to the idea that being popular is being cool, and being cool is a good thing because everyone likes cool and popular people or something. And given that the lone kid in the corner often is the target of bullying, no wonder it's a tendency for us to want to have at least some friends.</p>
				<p>There's practical benefit. If you have more friends, then if you ever want somebody to help you on homework or refer you for a job or hit you up with cool opportunities, you have more people to ask.</p>
				<p>Having more friends increases self-esteem. It's as if more people like you, which means that more people approve of you, which is also socially known to be good (whether this is actually good is something I often question, but it certainly makes you feel good).</p>
				<p>Of course, there's connection. For me, this is the number one benefit of having friends. It feels really, really good to be able to really connect with people. By connect, I'm not talking about just superficially relating to someone (like haha we both failed the midterm or something). I'm not saying relating doesn't feel good (it really does!!), but there's a warmer, unique feeling of being able to genuinely connect with someone that's impossible to describe; like love, but platonically? idk. But by connecting, I mean being able to understand what drives each other, being able to see their humanity, and being able to accept their unique lifestyle and mindset. It feels really, really good when subconsciously, you're able to accept a person for who they are, and it feels like they're able to accept you for who you are.</p>
				<p>There's, well, all the good things friends do for each other. I appreciate all my friends so much for everything that they've done. To my friends: you guys have done so much for me, so much that it's impossible to list everything. But I'll try. There are all the sweet words y'all send me: "good luck" before a test, "safe travels" before my flight home, "hope you're feeling better" when I'm struggling, the words of appreciation you send when I do the smallest things...</p>

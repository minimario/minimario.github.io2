                <h1>deliberate misinterpretation</h1>
				<p>so self-conscious me is continuously asking myself, "what do other people think about me?" self-conscious me won't stand up for himself because he wants to prevent certain answers to this question. he won't do ridiculous things for the same reason. he won't make large changes to himself. he won't propose things he doesn't believe in. he won't ask others for help. he won't satisfy his curiosity and ask others what he wants to know. he won't cry or scream in public. all for the same reason.</p>
				<p>i cry because i like to cry. sometimes, i cry because i need help, but often, it's because it just feels really good. but if i don't explain this, nobody would ever understand. they'd assume something is wrong, ask me what's wrong, and then i'd say nothing. and then they'd assume i didn't want to tell them and leave me alone or something (or press on my feelings a bit more until they either believed i just like crying or decided that i just wanted to be alone). but everything that's going in others' minds is probably just wrong. nobody really does understand what i'm feeling like when i'm crying or what's going through my mind. and i'm usually not in a state of mind to explain anyways. sometimes i'm just enjoying myself. but nobody knows that.</p>
				<p>there are misinterpretations you can suspect (like the above), but there are also misinterpretations that you're completely oblivious to. like when you explain something to someone and they get a completely different impression. that when someone smiles at you it's a sign that they like you (maybe they just smile all the time). that when you ask someone for money you're being a burden (maybe they really like being helpful, altruism is cool!)</p>
				<p>we're also often misinterpreting others just like the way they're misinterpreting us. all day, every day. i just assumed that if i cried that people will think i need help. i assume that when people are in a library that they don't want to be disturbed. i assume that when people are asleep that they don't want to be woken up. and it's pretty conceivable that most of these assumptions are wrong. we like being correct, so we usually don't question our assumptions all the time.</p>
				<p>but we have the power to manipulate our own stories. what if, the guy in the library really wished there were someone that would go up to him and talk to him about the book he were reading? what if the person who was asleep was really lonely the last night, went to sleep out of loneliness, and would be ecstatic if i woke him up and gave him company? while these stories aren't the first to come to mind, they're certainly imaginable. and with this imagination comes the power to manipulate yourself.</p>
				<p>this questioning of our own assumptions is a mechanism of inducing self-change. what if the people i ask for help really want to help me? what if the people i'm talking to really want to get to know me? what if people will just accept me for who i am? do i even know if my skepticism rises from pessimism or realism? there's most certainly a way i can convince myself that skepticism comes from pessimism, not from anything grounded in reality. and then when we begin to take in+accept that something is a pessimistic view, we suddenly become less pessimistic (but perhaps ironically, less realistic as well).</p>
				<p>so here's a nice way to induce change. deliberately misinterpret situations, but notice that your current interpretation is probably a misinterpretation anyways. so why is one misinterpretation more valid than another? haha, it's probably not. so then you will actually believe that your other misinterpretation is plausible. and then maybe that misinterpretation will cloud your mind and affect your mindset. and this is the key to change. if the visualization and the belief is strong enough, you'll delude yourself into believing that. and then you'll delude yourself into changing. after you make the change, you'll probably be honest with yourself and go like, wow i just manipulated myself. but, well, at least your short-term goal of making the change happened. and i imagine that part of the block of making the change is not knowing what the effect would be and satisfying the instant gratification gene. so even though you deluded yourself, you still made the change and won't revert it. something like that, idk if it made any sense</p>
				<p>now here is my biggest worry regarding the above mechanism. by doing this i'm manipulating myself and then convincing myself that this is okay. but maybe it's not. so my self-trust probably becomes undermined in some sense. i literally convinced myself of something, and then i realized i wasn't guarding against myself. so now i trust myself a little less. and maybe this will mess with my self-esteem. no idea.</p>
				<p>but this sounds interesting, it's just like all the visualization techniques. i read it somewhere before, but now i somehow am a little more convinced that it might work. we'll see.</p>

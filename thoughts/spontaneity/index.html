                <h1>spontaneity</h1>
				<p>I really like having control over my life. I like going into an activity with an idea of how pleasant it will be, what I might get from it, etc. But I also love spontaneity. I like randomly veering from my scheduled day and start doing things I never would have expected to. These seem like they conflict. I love exotic adventures, but I also love order in my life. How can I resolve this paradox?</p>
				<p>My theory for why this occurs is as follows. While I can control a lot of our life (lol do I believe in this?), one thing that is hard to predict and control is my feelings. I can&rsquo;t know how exactly I&rsquo;ll be feeling in the next 3 hours. I might have an idea that overall, I&rsquo;ll be feeling pretty happy or pretty sad, but I won&rsquo;t have control over some of the more spontaneous feeling that arise. While I can&rsquo;t speak for others&rsquo; experiences, I often get an urge to just go do something adventurous or do something relaxing or do something original, and this feeling seemingly pops out of nowhere. And after I do what my brain is telling me to do, I feel thrilled and fulfilled. Way more thrilled and fulfilled than if I had planned to do something and was anticipating it.</p>
				<p>There&rsquo;s a niceness to spontaneity. It&rsquo;s as if my mind is asking for something and I&rsquo;m giving it exactly what it wants instantly. And then it feels really satisfied. Sometimes, I wish I could plan for this spontaneity, since it would give my life more order. Which is also nice because certainty suddenly arises, and certainty is nice. There are times where I disappoint my spontaneous mind: like if I&rsquo;m craving a nice walk outside, but nobody&rsquo;s willing to go, or if I want to do something outdoors, but it suddenly starts raining. It would certainly have been nicer if I had asked some people earlier or checked the weather to make sure. But it&rsquo;s almost impossible for me to be able to predict that on a given day, in a few hours, I&rsquo;ll be in the mood to do X activity.</p>
				<p>My mind likes this element of surprise. There&rsquo;s probably some dopamine release that is connected to the anticipation of how I will feel in a few hours, and then some excitement connected to actually resolving this suspense and discovering what my feelings are, and then even more fulfillment occurring when I satisfy my feelings.</p>
				<p>This aspect of finding that surprise motivates me has also allowed me to get myself to do other things. I&rsquo;m very motivated to do things like experiencing rejection via absurdities. If I knew exactly how I would be rejected and how I would feel, I would be so much less motivated. But it&rsquo;s the combination of possibly not being rejected, discovering a new data point in my life, and discovering how I&rsquo;ll feel when I actually do something embarrassing/out of my comfort zone that makes it so thrilling to do something like this. It&rsquo;s also partially why self-help is so appealing to me. Because I have no idea how the brain works, and I can have a desired change that I want to make, but I&rsquo;ll suddenly change in so many other ways that I couldn&rsquo;t have possibly intended. Combined with the aspect that self-help is injecting additional data in my life and learning more about myself, that element of surprise is extremely fulfilling. It&rsquo;s also one of my motivations for meditation, as I&rsquo;ll never know what kind of thoughts pop up while I&rsquo;m in the middle of a meditation session.</p>
				<p>I also love novelty and exploration, a different facet of surprise. Exploring neighborhoods and cities, exploring myself, others, exploring how I feel while doing various activities, and so on. There&rsquo;s also a strange phenomenon where uniqueness that is not surprising feels (at least, to me) the exact same way surprise would. Things like walking on a frozen river are unique and feel the exact same as these spontaneous surprises, but I don&rsquo;t find these experiences surprising at all. I know (at least, I think I know) what happens when I walk on a frozen river: it&rsquo;s no different from walking on an ice rink.</p>
				<p>But who knows. Maybe all of this is absurd and is just an explanation I&rsquo;ve given to myself that seems to make sense. And I like when I can explain spontaneity away with reason. However, I can&rsquo;t. And therefore, I&rsquo;ve learned to embrace that feelings just arise and pop up for no reason. That some things are rather explained by &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a feeling.&rdquo; Well, reasons that I don&rsquo;t know and won&rsquo;t be able to know.</p>

                <h1>authenticity</h1>
				<p>ok so yes you should be authentic and being authentic is great. but instead of talking about why you should be authentic and how it fosters connection and all that good stuff i'll dedicate this post to why it's scary because it's something that i figured i deserve to give myself some clarity on</p>
				<p>so first of all showing change can be kind of scary, which sometimes makes me stick to my "old personality" when i'm around certain people that I last met a long time ago even though i've really changed a lot inside. this comes from the desire to be consistent. but another detractor is that if you change, people won't think they understand you as well as they did before, which feels unsettling (imo). and distance. and distance doesn't feel close, which is sad :((. consistency also shows up in a different form: if I suddenly become more authentic, what if I'm in a mood to just chill? this is actually authentic but doesn't seem as authentic as when I try to be authentic, so it makes me inconsistent once again (lol does this make sense?). i think a theme is just consistency and connection feel like they come hand in hand.</p>
				<p>it's also interesting to think about what vulnerabilities feel comfortable sharing and what don't. i think a general rule is that if it's stuff about myself, then it feels fine, where as if it's more relational stuff, it feels a little iffy sometimes. so sharing times i cried or felt really lonely or depressed feels way easier than sharing that i'm interested in getting to know someone better or that something they said really made me think about something.</p>
				<p>part of this is definitely just a fear of rejection. it feels more okay if you're sad and they don't respond as opposed to if you say you want to know them better and they give some equivalent of "nah." I also think I'm convinced that there are always people who aren't going to like me and it's fine, if everyone really did like me I'd wonder if I really were myself...</p>
				<p>but another interesting point is that i think there are power games at play here. so when you say something like "wow you said this, and this made me write 3 pages of crap," it's like admitting that they somehow have the power to make you do this. and it's not like i can't regain this power back (i mean, i can just force myself not to write anything when they say something if power's really what i want), but it's just that my mind probably has trouble not seeing impact as power. even when I read a book/watch anime that makes me cry the fact that "wow the author has the power to make me cry" feels really really unsettling. the flip side to this is that people like feeling as if they have an impact, and telling them these things generally makes them feel pretty good (i mean, who doesn't want to know that their story resonated really deeply with someone). so yeah, i should say more of these types of things since it seems like the type of thing where "exposure therapy" would just work (i also haven't done much circling/authentic relating things recently so more of that definitely would help)</p>
				<p>another obvious time when it's hard to be authentic is, of course, when you're first meeting someone. I think we all have autopilot scripts for meeting new people, and that we've memorized these scripts so well we don't even need to think at all to be able to execute them reasonably well. but when I meet someone completely fresh (i.e. no prior connections and stuff), there's always self-imposed pressure to convince them that I am a person that is valuable to be around. the way I think about it is like, i could be myself, but first of all i don't even trust this person so being myself would feel unnatural. second of all, does normal me project a "someone to hang out more" vibe? probably not as much as if I tried to deliver more value! and even if i've decided that i don'r really resonate with them and don't really care about forming a long-term friendship with them for whatever reason, having the option to continue being friends + letting them think they met someone cool and interesting + a positive impression is always nice, right? honestly not sure if this is a case where i want to be too much more authentic..!</p>
				<p>one last barrier is hidden assumptions. often, when someone says something (say something makes me feel really unsettled), there's a long backstory behind my feelings and reactions. such as maybe there's a suppressed memory somewhere inside me from my childhood that suddenly got touched. but of course, we don't always feel like explaining ourselves, so they might end up seeing us as, for example, "sensitive." so it's like we're only partially communicating but it would take too long to fully communicate, so this is uncomfortable. this is also why i'm willing to be more vulnerable I know i'll have 2 hours to talk to someone, because there will be time to explain everything (like if i'm embarrassed, i feel a slight desire to point that out and explain why)</p>
				<p>i should also mention that this reflection was a result of me listing a bunch of situations in which authenticity felt uncomfortable and then trying to distill/categorize them. another note is that the discomfort of authenticity feels distinctly different from the discomfort of rejection therapy (i tried a mark manson thing recently and it didn't go well eeee) in that a lot of the discomfort of the latter stems from _not_ being authentic.</p>

                <h1>friends, part 2</h1>
				<p><span>foreword: so i was originally writing some things down in my journal regarding where i find value in my friends, but it then naturally turned into something like a list of why i appreciate them. and, well, it is the end of the year, so it's a nice time to spread warm feels and share appreciative thoughts. alas, it was quite a sentimental experience going through all the episodes that constituted my past year. this felt really, really good to write. here goes:</span></p>
				<p><span>dearest friends,</span></p>
				<p><span>it's that time of year where i look back upon everything that's been me for the past months and reflected upon how all of your distinct personalities, characters, and perspectives have shaped who i am today. while i won't go as far as to label that every interaction has been pleasant, i'd like to point out that every interaction was a unique moment that can't be repeated again.</span></p>
				<p><span>this year, i've had so many tender moments, and while it's impossible to recreate them again in real life, we can reminisce by replaying the memories of our past year in our minds. from things as large as giving me comfort in my most desperate moments to things as small as liking a facebook post that hooked me for a few hours, all of you have a permanent place in the story that is my life. for love, for nostalgia, and to continue the positive vibes that is holiday season, i'd like to dedicate this post to all of you and convey my deep and earnest appreciation for your place in my story. ah, where shall i begin&hellip;.</span></p>
				<p><span>i'll start by mentioning all the quick yet meaningful things that you have said that, despite being small, are memorable. i remember the times you guys have wished me "good luck" before a (con)test, "safe travels" before my flights home, "hope you're feeling better" when I've visibly (and not visibly!) struggling, "are you doing alright" when I come home from a party and clearly don't seem normal, and of course, the genuine "how are you feeling" and "how are you"'s that let me know how much all of you guys cared about my well-being. while these are just simple and commonplace phrases that are always thrown around, these words really do carry a hopeful positive energy</span></p>
				<p><span>i also remember all the retreats that i've gone on, where i've met so many amazing people with so much potential. to anyone that i've ever met on one of these outings: you are the reason that each and every one of these retreats is such a special and perspective-shifting experience. while i haven't gotten a chance to catch up a most of you in a long time, i'd be more than happy to reconnect! i still have all the compliment bags from these retreats and from time to time, when I lose my sense of self, go back and read the compassionate and moving messages you all wrote for me: i remember the "best wishes" and "have a bright future" blessings, the moments you told me how much something I said resonated with you, how good you felt when we just sat outside under the stars and shared our lives, and how touched you all were when i shared with you the story that is my life. and even though you wrote these notes to me after knowing me for only a few days, it felt like we've known each other for so much longer. and even without seeing all your faces and hearing all your insights that you have to bring, just rereading these notes give me a poignant sense of reconnection. i can really feel all of the authenticity and thoughtfulness that came into these (even if we were rushed to make them before we had to go), and well, thanks to all of you and your uniqueness for making my college experience so much better~</span></p>
				<p><span>finally, i can't finish talking about words without thinking about everything that everyone has said that has really resonated with me. so many of your words have made me think and rethink who I am as a human being; all of them have positively contributed to my self-love and self-acceptance. i remember all the positive words that you've shared: the words of gratitude that you've shared for the smallest things i did for you, the intermittent but genuine compliments, the words of encouragement and motivation that have made me calm when i should have felt anxious, and the perspectives you all brought when i needed advice. but I can't leave out the importance and impact of all the hard-to-hear things that i really needed to keep myself sane and in check: the constructive criticism you've offered me in the most respectful ways, the times you told me how sad or angry I made you feel, the critiques on my writing or music, the times when you earnestly told me that something i did was bothering you, and the personal feedback that you all gave me. while it's hard to appreciate these things in the moment, it's without a doubt that looking back, these words were the forces helping me learn and grow into an even better version of myself</span></p>
				<p><span>your words are great, but your silence is even better. i get so much nostalgia just thinking about the times we just stared in each others' eyes, the times we made various forms of human contact but never said a word, the times we cried together for absolutely no reason at all. i'll never forget the times we screamed or yelled or made completely incomprehensible noises together on both the harvard bridge and random isolated neighborhoods. yes, a lack of words can truly be a beautiful thing</span></p>
				<p><span>y'all gave me silence when i needed it the most. i'll leave it at that</span></p>
				<p><span>thanks for spreading so much love through silence, in the infinitely many times where i sat there and ranted about my life. while i told you about all the struggles that i was going through, while i shared with you, unprompted, all of the underlying mess that was me. maybe all you did was nod, show facial sympathy, or gave me hugs. maybe all you did was sit there, expressing a mood that without a doubt conveyed empathy. really, i can't even explain in words how great i felt just knowing that you cared, wanted to listen, and did as much as you could to support me</span></p>
				<p><span>the reverse felt just as nice. i will never forget all the times that you came to me, fully open and transparent about all your problems, signaling a deep trust in me and conveying that i'd be able to help you through whatever you're experiencing or that you believed in me to somehow make you feel better. you'd that after so many times, i'd be bored of hearing more of your problems, but in all sincerity, i appreciate every single time you've given me the opportunity to experience your world and trusted me to improve it. i appreciate the permission you've given me to see you as you really are and the trust you have in me with your authentic self. honestly, you probably had more trust in me than I had in myself. i'll admit that i may have felt a little anxious about not knowing how to help. but it really warms my heart to know that you trust me enough to give me an opportunity to make you feel better. it makes me feel valuable. it makes me feel better as a human being. and it gives me an opportunity to help the people that matter to me most. i appreciate every opportunity that you guys gave me to play a part in bettering your lives</span></p>
				<p><span>you've taught me and inspired me more than I ever could have imagined. i've learned how to say data structures in chinese to impress my manager, how to cry whenever i want to, how to find novel and stunningly creative ways to sleep, how to chug beers dutch style, how to dance with a chair in front of me, how to count the number of mosquitoes inside a desert, how to keep my stuffed dog safe from theft, and how to create a music video from scratch. while i might forget everything i learned in my classes, these random bursts of knowledge that you've shared with me will always stick with me. you've inspired and helped me start a blog, find solace in all flavors of writing, create an edm remix of 學貓叫, discover my own motivations, read a variety of life-changing books, tape a free hugs sign to my dorm room door, and most importantly, really drive inside me why i should love and value all of you guys</span></p>
				<p><span>i'll also cherish all the moments of solitude we had together. to all of you that ever asked or agreed to take walks with me, wherever it may have been, i wholeheartedly enjoyed your company. each one of the hundreds of nights we've walked along the river side of dorm row was a preciously intimate moment away from the barrage of problem sets and quizzes and exams and projects and club meetings that have slowly gotten to take over our lives. it was those moments that made my day, those priceless moments where i could take a moment to slow down, get in touch with myself, and unwind against the serene backdrop of the only thing constant: the all too familiar skyline that will forever outline the liveliness of life on the other side of the charles river. there were also scenes less familiar that we discovered together: everything from the stillness of suburban fremont and csueb to the turmoil of oakland and sf at night</span></p>
				<p><span>i'm grateful for all the gifts and notes you all gave me for my birthday, the cards of appreciation and bananagrams and care packages i've been blessed with, the times you've brought something for me when i accidentally left it at next house, the times you came to my piano concerts and dance shows, and all the times you've come to my room just to visit me. while i maybe not have taken the time to give you proper appreciation, sorry about that, i assure you that all these things you've done for me have made me feel infinitely better</span></p>
				<p><span>thanks for letting me be who i am. for tolerating me as i prioritized my 8 hours of sleep over getting our psets and projects done, played variations of 喜羊羊 theme song in the next house tfl, caused you to fall as you tried biking without hands, got rid of my bed frame, made you visit the mess that is my dorm room, stole a rug and put it in the washing machine, learned to meow, shouted 'coq is ready' in frustration, and embarrassed myself harder than you ever could have imagined through my feeble attempts at rejection therapy. it's this respect and acceptance that you've all shown that gives me the confidence to be myself and continue living a fulfilled, personalized life</span></p>
				<p><span>i can't finish this without mentioning all the wild experiences we've had together. i can saliently remember almost throwing up on the boba marathon and during suboptimal m&amp;m games, getting hilariously lost on spontaneous T and uber trips, being rejected every time i persistently asked for delicacies like vegetarian duck and chicken, going inside a tesla and the top of prudential and an erotic store on the same evening, almost falling asleep on an all-nighter exploration of boston, walking on a frozen charles river, discovering more than i could ever ask for through intimate storytelling, uncovering bizarre scenes through bike rides around the bay, and making beautiful designs with elevator buttons</span></p>
				<p><span>yeah wow it was really nice writing this, i'm just so happy that all of you are who you are. thinking about all the different ways that i've met you and how different y&rsquo;all are feels surreal. whether it was something normal like classes and clubs or something more exotic like random matching apps and spontaneous dm's, there's not a single one of you that i regret getting to know. no matter how close we are, no matter how many times we've talked, and no matter what experiences we've had together, i want you to know that i dearly appreciate the existence of every one of you for who you are. to those that i haven't seen in a long time or those that i haven't really gotten the chance to really know, your existence hasn't gone unnoticed. i still think about the times we've spent together whenever your name pops up on the sidebar of facebook's chat, in my email, or gets mentioned in passing by another friend. yes, i still think about you. we have so much in common: we're both human. indeed, there's a miraculous aspect of humanity where everyone finds their own journey and transforms in their own selves. we can't transmit our thoughts. we can't feel each others' feelings. we can't live each others' experiences. but what we can do is find our place in each others' stories.</span></p>
				<p><span>to all you wonderful human beings, you've all really helped make this a remarkable and eventful year. now, with all that behind us, shall we create more memories together? &lt;3</span></p>

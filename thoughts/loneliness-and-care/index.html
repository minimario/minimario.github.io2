                <h1>loneliness and care</h1>
				<p>Why do I feel like my friends don&rsquo;t care about me? There are obvious reasons: I&rsquo;m taking another 84 units of classes, doing a UROP, practicing piano for 10 hours a week, spending my entire Saturdays doing MIT Driverless, etc. It makes sense: with all of these commitments, how could I possibly have time for my friends? But when I look at each week, I still an average of around 20 hours a week with my friends. While it is less than half of what it was last semester, it&rsquo;s still a good amount, and an amount that would give me a healthy social life. But I feel lonely. Lonely in the sense that I&rsquo;m slowly distancing from my friends from last semester, in the sense that I don&rsquo;t feel like there are people that will provide me the care that I&rsquo;m looking for, lonely in the sense that I don&rsquo;t have someone that I feel, both from the inside and the outside, really cares about me. I feel companionship and friendship all around me, but I haven't been able to feel the same degree of care I felt both semesters last year.</p>
				<p>Partially, it&rsquo;s my fault. This semester has been extremely rough. Family issues, friendship issues, insecurity issues, and relationship issues have become entangled together into a hot mess. And I haven&rsquo;t given much time to myself as I usually do in previous years. The bigger problem, however, is that I&rsquo;ve been much more reluctant to ask for help. In past semesters, my conversations used to be much more personal. I would frequently tell people more about things that were going on, even if they weren&rsquo;t the happiest. But this semester, I somehow convinced myself that I&rsquo;d be more considerate and sensitive toward other people when it came to how I would interact with them. And so any time I thought about telling other people about myself, I came up with excuse after excuse: what if they just make things worse for them? what if they don&rsquo;t really care about me, and I&rsquo;m wasting their time anyways? what if they don&rsquo;t want to hear about my problems? what if they&rsquo;re too busy anyways? what if helping me just makes them more stressed about their ability to be a good friend? In all honesty, all of these worries do make sense, since all these things are things that people have actually told me in the past regarding asking for help. Given that most of the time, my life just wasn&rsquo;t together, it was also pretty hard to talk about just the positive aspects of my life, since it always felt disingenuous that I was consciously omitting the entire other side that had been overwhelming me. And to be completely honest, a large part of the time, when I tell people about all the disasters that go on in my life, things end up worse than when I hadn&rsquo;t. As if I&rsquo;ve just wasted like three hours of my life for nothing.</p>
				<p>Except the only reason it feels like a waste is because after I tell people these things, I become overly emotional and stop seeing the bigger picture. It is true that sometimes, people aren&rsquo;t able to help me or make me feel better. But this is just me getting torn up by a lack of short term results. Think &ldquo;instant gratification&rdquo; or something like that. The instant after I talk through something depressing that&rsquo;s going on in my life, I only think about how much better I&rsquo;m feeling right after I tell them as compared to right before. But what I overlook is the subtext that &ldquo;somebody was willing to give up their whole night for me.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s sweet. Extremely sweet. So sweet that it&rsquo;s one of the unique things that someone can do that will make me feel loved for, cared for, and accepted at the same time. After I wait a week, I remember the few hours that they spent with me, and I realize how precious those hours are. I feel genuine care. Yes, the feeling is amazing. I&rsquo;ve realized there&rsquo;s so much long term happiness that comes when you just sit together with someone and talk about your lives together. Human connection, or something like that.</p>
				<p>But when you tell them less, they start to tell you less, and in response you tell them even less, and so on. And at the end, you don&rsquo;t know anything about each others&rsquo; lives, no wonder you can feel connection slowly fading away. In reality, when I used to tell people about my problems, the expectation wasn&rsquo;t even that they&rsquo;d help me fix them or even give me any advice at all. It was more about sharing my world with someone else and feeling that bit of connection, feeling the joy of having people that will simply listen to you. My point isn&rsquo;t even for my friends to help me. My point is to be able to create an environment where we&rsquo;re able to just share our lives in their raw form, no matter how good or how bad.</p>
				<p>This semester, something changed. I have no idea what it is: is it really that I wanted to be more considerate towards my friends? Is it that this semester has been exponentially worse to the point where I&rsquo;d feel vulnerable sharing everything? Is it that there&rsquo;s less time to self reflect, making me less willing to share things I hadn&rsquo;t sorted out? Is it just that I&rsquo;ve become more self-conscious about telling people who I am? I think all of these things are true to some degree, though I really can&rsquo;t tell which ones resonate more.</p>
				<p>I&rsquo;ve felt company plenty of times since September, but I&rsquo;ve only felt connection 5-6 times since then until recently, when things got better I was able to &ldquo;be myself&rdquo; again. Part of it comes from my internal discomfort in sharing my world with my friends. It feels safe, because if you keep your own worries to yourself nothing will ever go wrong, right? Looking back, I wished I hadn&rsquo;t told people I was okay I was literally dying and falling apart inside. I wished I hadn&rsquo;t continuously resorted to finding an isolated place on campus and just shyly crying away inside. I wished I trusted myself enough to be able to tell my friends what was going on. I wished I hadn&rsquo;t shielded myself from my own problems, distracting myself with testing my compiler and finishing my model checker. If I were to redo the semester, I would have given myself more time and space to accurately reflect on what was going on. I gave up time I had to reflect on my life for classes, for satisfying other peoples&rsquo; desires, for doing things I didn&rsquo;t even need to be doing. I say this with discomfort, but it feels like I gave up my true self and true values in exchange for everything else in my life.</p>
				<p>(wow looking back, this was completely&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;what I was intending to write about. but writing this made me feel so much better about myself so I guess that&rsquo;s always nice!)</p>

            <h1>accomplishment</h1>
            <p>every semester, i tell myself that i want to accomplish something personally meaningful, like starting a
                community, developing myself, building a project, etc. but then, the semester flies by, i look back, and
                realize that once again, <em>i haven&apos;t actually done anything</em>. every semester feels so
                productive: i work a few dozen hours a week, grinding through technical material that, well, i may as
                well never use again. i constantly mirage myself with the illusion of productivity, of accomplishments,
                of successes. i blindly chase social signals of success, deluding myself with naive self-confidence:
                good grades, job offers, publications infusing into me slight tinges of self-assurance.</p>
            <p>it&apos;s those little dopamine hits that have spoiled me, preventing me from seeing the real picture:
                that really, i haven&apos;t really accomplished anything that i&apos;ve wanted to. it&apos;s so easy to
                just feel like you&apos;re doing things on a day to day basis without remembering the real picture of
                what you really wanted. really, to me, i always told myself that enjoying something means enjoying not
                just the outcomes, but the journey itself, enjoying the struggles that naturally arise. but sometimes,
                i&apos;ve hit obstacles again and again, and before i ever successfully reached the goal, i just gave
                up, or stopped, or modified the goal enough so that it became easy and no longer felt meaningful to me.
            </p>
            <p>over and over, i&apos;ve wondered if i&apos;ve intrinsically lost motivation over the years. this summer,
                i interned at a software engineer at a high-paying finance firm. every day <em>felt productive</em>, i
                mean, i was writing and pushing code, new features were being built, etc. i was getting paid, i was
                outside partying or socializing or exploring nyc almost every night. people around me were living my
                life, spending dozens of dollars on food each meal, carelessly making bets and throwing around money.
                whether true or not, at least, that&apos;s how it felt. and i started to wonder, why try so hard? why
                should i try so hard to &quot;accomplish anything&quot;? why don&apos;t i just lower my standards and
                tell myself that this summer, i really did accomplish something?</p>
            <p>back in high school, i had the capability of being razor-focused, of working over ten hours a day for
                seven days a week, grinding competitive programming problems. where&apos;d that energy go?? back then, i
                loved solving algorithmic puzzles and was driven by the constant competitive environment, which would
                inspire me to practice again and again. i was part of a healthy social circle of people who enjoyed
                solving programming puzzles for fun, and having so many people part of a community really fostered my
                love for what i did. in addition, i would always tell myself that my advantage wasn&apos;t intelligence,
                but rather hard work. and so i thought to myself, if i just worked hard enough, that eventually i&apos;d
                be as good as my friends who might have learned faster. i would also remember, when my friends sent me
                puzzles they needed help with, that i&apos;d be so motivated by wanting to help them that i&apos;d spend
                hours and hours trying to solve them.</p>
            <p>the difference is that back then, i had one goal, was committed to that goal, and knew, somehow, that i
                wanted to achieve it. now, i don&apos;t really have a single goal that i&apos;m focused towards. even if
                i did, i&apos;d probably question myself, constantly asking myself whether or not it&apos;s worthwhile
                to even chase that goal. instead, i just tell myself that i want to <em>do something</em>. i don&apos;t
                know what the something is, it&apos;s just a latent hope that&apos;s always on the back of my mind.</p>
            <p>on the inside, something really doesn&apos;t feel right. ok, so what if i do accomplish something? maybe
                there will be pride from making an amazing scientific discovery, or warmth from launching a wholesome
                community, or gratification from launching a startup personally meaningful to me. but will that really
                happen? would it be worth all of life that i sacrificed? i still ask myself if i&apos;m just purely
                delusional, like, if it&apos;s that easy, why doesn&apos;t everyone just do it? and if i were to work
                towards one singular goal, i&apos;d probably just question myself over and over, i mean, i used to be
                really motivated to just <em>do things,</em> but now, i&apos;m struggling to even find inspiration and
                certainty.</p>
            <p>perhaps part of it is that so many of my peers are just outright satisfied with their full-time swe jobs.
                that they&apos;re just happy how they are, and somehow that means i should also be happy if i were in
                their position. i think i&apos;d be fine, but i wouldn&apos;t be happy. i still can&apos;t pinpoint why
                i&apos;m so driven by the need to accomplish something.</p>
            <p>so let&apos;s talk about children now. i was told once that once you have children, well, you start fully
                dedicating yourself to them and stop really caring about anything else. and maybe that&apos;s true. for
                me, children are an accomplishment. for me, raising a child successfully would probably feel more
                fulfilling than anything else i&apos;ll probably achieve in my life.</p>
            <p>so i don&apos;t know. i think that thirty years later, i&apos;ll probably have accomplished something.
                but maybe it&apos;ll be because i&apos;ll have relaxed my definition of accomplishment by then. maybe
                it&apos;ll be because i&apos;ve gotten myself together. clarified my goals. understood what i want.
                accepted my own capabilities and ambitions for what they are, without hallucinating more than i&apos;m
                really capable of. but until then, i&apos;ll still hope, i&apos;ll still try, and i&apos;ll still
                daydream of realizing my potentially fantastical notions of success.</p>

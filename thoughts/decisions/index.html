                <h1>some brief thoughts on decision making</h1>
                <p>- it&rsquo;s interesting when we try to notice all of the (smallest) decisions we&rsquo;re making in our lives and overthink all of them</p>
                <p>- basing life decisions off of the pareto principle maximizes some sense of value</p>
                <p>- the time it takes to make a decision is time out of your life</p>
                <p>- a lot of &ldquo;hard decisions&rdquo; don&rsquo;t matter either way and more time is not going to increase your capability of making a better decision</p>
                <p>- asking other people to help you make decisions increases trust both ways</p>
                <p>- if you&rsquo;re choosing from a finite number of options, maybe you&rsquo;re not being creative enough</p>
                <p>- wisdom of crowds is a nice framework for decision making</p>
                <p>- cost-benefit analysis is usually too impractical and inaccurate</p>
                <p>- the value of emotions is very hard to judge, it&rsquo;s important to make decisions when not being super emotional but also being able to factor emotions into a decision is important</p>
                <p>- some type of &ldquo;stakeholder analysis&rdquo; but pretending you&rsquo;re all the stakeholders gives you a lot of perspective</p>
                <p>- gut feeling is surprisingly useful and looking into your body&rsquo;s reactions to a decision gives you a lot of information on possible emotional outcomes</p>
                <p>- i tend to be quite optimistic when i map out the outcomes of a decision, so i&rsquo;m more likely to make higher variance decisions if i perceive them to be similar in value</p>
                <p>- the longer i think about a decision, the less intimate it feels</p>
                <p>- there are probably trends associated with the &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; of a decision vs. things like time since last meal, time of day, happiness, emotional amplitude, etc.; might be worth thinking about these trends</p>
                <p>- if you make some number of decisions in a row, the 1st one usually isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;best&rdquo; one</p>
